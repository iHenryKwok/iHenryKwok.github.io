## Biography

I am a third-year undergraduate student from Zhejiang University. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. 

I come from Ocean College and major in Ocean Engineering and Technology. Meanwhile, I am interested in Computer Science and AI. Therefore, in addition to my major courses, I have taken many core courses from the College of Computer Science (as detailed on my transcript) and actively participated in AI-related research projects. I am currently seeking PhD/MPhil opportunities in the field of deep learning.

## Research Experiences

***2023.06 - present	video editing***

......

***2023.02 - 2023.04	Robust Sentence-Level Evaluation (Yale Remote RA)***

under review

***2022.07 - 2022.10	Underwater Overlapping Fish Detection Study (ZJU SRTP)*** 

Based on yolov5, we perform detection of underwater targets. Our work consists mainly in adding preprocessing, adding attention mechanisms and using pre-trained models.

***2022.11 - 2022.12	Voice Conversion (CUHK AIST2010 class project)*** 

We proposed a method for regenerating music based on some given music track. We use Multi-scale Multi-band DenseNet to seperate the vocal and the background music, and then use the voice conversion method to change the two parts.
